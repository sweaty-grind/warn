# warn

so i figured it out how to stop coming here.. wait some more time...  wait some more time...  the whole time you spent it doing more moronic research at the cost of my mind and body now.... bro.  its tight in here...  

i think i know what is going on.  apparently your science is bunk you had to get some special wavelengths to spend on healing the brain and i heal the brain and you gather those certain wavelengths that make it good.  and so on...

so i wonder why i am doing good work and i have to tolerate this bull shit called the cheapskate system.  i thought i should have just fucked myself rather than do this crap for you.  you know??? i dont feel good beating on you cause you stink...  sounds familiar??  i wonder how much burden you put on me for nothing in return...  you spent it all these years what the fuck is the difference???

drinking my first monster. somehow this doesn't look very good on my body.  didn't sleep either..  2L of pure caffeine will keep you at bay until you go to the gas station...  and get monsters...lol

so you may be confused about what is going on.  i'm gonna let it out like this, this shark costs me too much i'm already dead drained and ahead of my mk ultra project...  how do you escape a shark dude? rub its nose.  i didn't know you were this retarded though.  relying on junk.  everything has to be paid for you may be running up the last bits of your credit.  you know???

so the safety net begins here lol...  cia dont wanna play cia and shit so i did the cool it money on your asses...

hmm. should realize my body is gonna fuck itself...
